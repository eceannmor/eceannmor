## ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️
GitHub is using automated systems to suspend accounts, and it has interfeared with the availability of study materials for my students. \
Student resources are currently mirrored on GitLab for redundancy - [gitlab.com/eceannmor](https://gitlab.com/eceannmor/)

I am in the process of setting up a private git server to not have a constant threat of rouge bots with admin powers. \
[eceannmor.com](https://eceannmor.com/) will always have up-to-date links.
